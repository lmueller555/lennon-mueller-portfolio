# Lennon Mueller Portfolio

This repository contains a simple static portfolio site. The site is deployed using **GitHub Pages** through the workflow defined in `.github/workflows/static.yml`.

To view the page after the workflow runs, visit the GitHub Pages URL for the repository.

The home page includes a dynamic typing animation in the banner. If the page does not immediately show the updated banner, ensure the Pages workflow has completed successfully and refresh your browser.
